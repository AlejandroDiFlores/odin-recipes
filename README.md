Captain's Log,

Is the nerdy way I want to start this. Practice is practice. I am not sure what this project is just yet, I'm just following instructions as it stands but it seems that this will be filled later. 

Okay, now I know. I created a website format using html only and added links that route to the recipes I've added for enchiladas, pot roast and sopita. This is very barebones as I am learning, but I did not want to spend too much time on the actual ingredient, and focused on the practice itself.
